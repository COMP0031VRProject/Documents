EC Discussion | Yangtao | * Ask Diego About he possibilties to get an EC with reason (i.e. Covid-19, Remote work, Delay of starting) <br> * Do everything in time <br> * Apply for automated EC in department level|
Idea Share | Mark | * A brief idea of how a spring algorithm work <br> Demo with python
Idea Share | Choi | * A brief idea of how a spring algorithm work <br> * Slides avaliable on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/7B1AABD4-EFF1-40E8-B8C3-796237BC33A6?tenantId=1faf88fe-a998-4c5b-93c9-210a11d9a5c2&fileType=pptx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fliveuclac.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCOMP0030-VR%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FDev%20Meeting%20%231.pptx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fliveuclac.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCOMP0030-VR&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:4ab6b08a813e44d786e8de10dc884ef7@thread.tacv2&groupId=7aa51968-5516-4532-94a2-009d3efbc60a) <br> * Agree on we should currently focus on this idea and discuss with Diego next Tuesday <br> * Question discussions about how we can improve this (1. Scaling factor drop 2. Bot Simulation with the deviated path 3. Possibility of other idea) <br> * Could have the basic math code structure based on this method, since it is resuable <br> Use `Python` to implement the math part |
Demo Share| Paul | * Demo with Unity for NaviField-like experimental scene. <br> * Should be a part of demo for next Tuesday
Project Plan for next week | All Team | * Created tickets for next Tuesday <br> * Mostly based on documentation stuff
